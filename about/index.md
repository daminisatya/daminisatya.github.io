I'm an ardent open source contributor and strive to code every single day. All my toughts and imagination, if doesn't fit well into computers, I put them on canvases. 

I speak and write a lot of languages where both humans and computers can understand. Im not partial in this case! I would love to explore the world, espcially on google. If given a chance i would like to create a series of art work on "How machines feel"!

## Preview (About myself :P)

I do only three things everyday,
#Run (Cause I love taking part in marathons)
#code
#paint

If you are one such person with same set of skills, you are welcome to join me on twitter!
