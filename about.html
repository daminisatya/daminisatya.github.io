				                <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:justify;">”People can steal money but not knowledge or education.” These words from my mother who is a teacher, always reverberate in my mind. She worked really hard to give me the best education possible. She never failed to inspire me. Being the first person to graduate from an Engineering college in my entire family, I have a special place at home. Coming from a slightly upper middle class family in India, education really was the necessary medium for us for a better future.

                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 

                                Throughout my education, I’ve crossed paths with some amazing people and wellwishers, who made a positive impact on the way I think. I always had control on my mind and emotions and thrived hard to condition it towards achieving my goals. In 2009, I was elected as HEAD GIRL of the school and served as a office bearer with utmost diligence. Holding a position of responsibility, I noticed others like me and wanted to make a difference to them. I never failed to help my peers cope up with their studies and considering the importance I give to education. After my schooling I was able to make my parents proud by achieving the prestigious ”NRK Moorthy gold medal” for topping the school board examinations.

                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 

                                After my schooling, I took up computer science and engineering during my undergraduate studies at a women’s college, having faced serious health issues, there was a time when I couldn’t afford to give time to focus on academics. These gloomy moments never pulled me back. I recollected the words told by my mother whenever I feel demotivated. I worked very hard day and night, playing the role of a student and being a mentor to my brother and efforts to achieve a scholarship. I worked more than 14 hours a day studying, researching, and staying back at college labs late programming. All this effort has helped me achieve the academic excellence award. I continued to work hard and knowing how many women and girls drop out of education and out of STEM programs in India, I decided to do my bit to give back and founded the FOSS club of my college involving more women and girls in technology and motivating them to build their careers in technology. This continued for the next four semesters and I obtained the internship from Google summer of code with FOSSASIA. Somewhere in my heart I feel like I’ve got a lot to learn to complement my undergraduate programme and be able to make the best use of my education and do something where I can serve society, to the underprivileged and create an impact on all the women, the right way using my knowledge.

                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 

                                I believe in the power of education and the impact that educated individuals can deliver to society. I want to be a part of that change, to do my bit to push the human race forward.
