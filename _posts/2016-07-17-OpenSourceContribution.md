Open source works by having many people contribute to the creation and maintenance of software. Thing is, it works well only when people are actually contributing. For many programmers, though, the thought of contributing to open source projects seems too difficult and time-consuming. They think that you have to be a programming genius blessed with unlimited free time to make a meaningful contribution. That’s simply not true. Successful open source projects thrive on a wide variety of contributions from people with all levels of coding skills and commitment. If just one person fixes a compiler warning, closes a bug, or adds to the documentation, pretty soon you’re talking real progress. For many people, the hardest part is just getting started. So this blog post helps you with the essential take aways. 

## Choose a project on Github

This initial step is very important for you to go ahead. Choose that particular project which is close to your interest and skill set. Keep in mind about the activeness of the project and the contribution level of the owner or the project creator. The following points must be in mind when you start hunting for good projects.

* Check for the activeness of the project. 
* You can do this by checking the last commit dates and the activeness of the issues and PRs(Pull requests) getting merging.
* Check out for the language stub which suits your skill set.
* Last, make sure the project interests you to contribute to it!

## Fork it and clone

So here are few terms which come in handy while exploring the README.md files for installation instructions. 

* PR - Pull request is sent to show your changes and request for review. This is a safer way to get the initial bugs out and code coverages.
* Issue - So Github has a issue tracker for each project where you can find open issues or bugs found in the project. You can even use the issue tracker for posting new feature introductions 
* Fork - Forking is a process where you create a separate copy for your self into your account. You that piece of project code is into your stub. 
* Clone - This process helps you to dump the project code into your machine. Interesting right?

## Report a bug

Bug/issue management is one of the least sexy ways to contribute to an open source project, but it’s also one of the most important. When you find a bug in an open source package you use, report it into the project’s bug tracking system. This is probably the single most useful thing you can do to contribute to a project, because if users don’t report bugs, chances are that the developers won’t find about them. If the developers knew about the bugs, they would have fixed them, right? If you really want to help, take the time to do a good solid write-up into the project’s bug tracking system.

## Verify and track down a reported bug

You can also go through the bug tracking system and help improve existing trouble tickets. Find a bug and see if you can reproduce it on your system. This can be invaluable to the developers trying to narrow down the cause of a problem.


## Write an example for the documentation

Few developers are eager to write documentation, but it’s critical to the success of open source projects. What’s the first thing you look for when exploring a new project? The documentation. And what’s the first thing you look for in that documentation? Examples of how to use it. It’s easy to come up with examples for the documentation if you’ve been using the software for a while. For projects related to programming, such as a library or a framework, create a simple example that shows a common use case of the code. In many cases, you can take working code of your own, extract the most interesting parts, and you have a real-world example to help new users understand quickly. For applications, a few screenshots of common usage of the tool will go a long way to help new users.

## Edit the project wiki

Wikis are becoming more and more prevalent as an easy way for people to contribute to project documentation. For some projects, like the Solr search engine, the project doesn’t have standalone documentation, leaving the wiki as the primary source of documentation. The beauty of wikis is that there’s no minimum barrier to entry, so it’s easy to make contributions with a minimum of fuss. Adding a sentence here, a paragraph there takes only minutes but becomes part of the project forever, helping untold numbers of users down the line.

## Answer a question

Time spent helping others is an investment in the project as much as writing code. The more qualified users of the software that join in helps grow the project as a whole. If you’re at all experienced with a given piece of open source software, you’re probably able to help people who are newer to it than you are. Try to lend a hand to others who are struggling. A great place to start is StackOverflow, which has become the preeminent Q&amp;A site for programmers helping other programmers. If your expertise runs more toward server administration, SO’s sister site ServerFault is a great place to help contribute your knowledge. Of course, many projects have their own dedicated forums and mailing lists devoted. Sign up for one and see how you can help. Remember, the newbie you help today may someday contribute great new features

## Career path

We don&#39;t want to undermine one’s intelligence by making you believe that the number of jobs in OSS(open source software) is much higher than that for proprietary software. However; though smaller, it is a niche market. Today it would be easier to get a C/C++ programmer job. In order to get developers who have programmed in newer technologies like Python, or Ruby, and who have understood the community, its trends, and its ways of working would certainly take a lot more time and effort. Just as we make correct technology choices for a software solution based on its architecture, organizations need to make choices to find the right fit for the right job. With the growing trends of involvement and usage of OSS in companies the demand for open source developers to take up this work is definitely on the rise. In summary, OSS jobs are increasing. It’s still a niche area, but its growth potential makes it worth exploring. Needless to say that being an expert in a niche area always calls for a premium salary for oneself.
