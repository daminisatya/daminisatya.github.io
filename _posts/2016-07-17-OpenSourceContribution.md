Open source works by having many people contribute to the creation and maintenance of software. Thing is, it works well only when people are actually contributing. For many programmers, though, the thought of contributing to open source projects seems too difficult and time-consuming. They think that you have to be a programming genius blessed with unlimited free time to make a meaningful contribution. That’s simply not true. Successful open source projects thrive on a wide variety of contributions from people with all levels of coding skills and commitment. If just one person fixes a compiler warning, closes a bug, or adds to the documentation, pretty soon you’re talking real progress. For many people, the hardest part is just getting started. So this blog post helps you with the essential take aways. 

## Choose a project on Github

This initial step is very important for you to go ahead. Choose that particular project which is close to your interest and skill set. Keep in mind about the activeness of the project and the contribution level of the owner or the project creator. The following points must be in mind when you start hunting for good projects.

* Check for the activeness of the project. 
* You can do this by checking the last commit dates and the activeness of the issues and PRs(Pull requests) getting merging.
* Check out for the language stub which suits your skill set.
* Last, make sure the project interests you to contribute to it!

## Fork it and clone

So here are few terms which come in handy while exploring the README.md files for installation instructions. 

* PR - Pull request is sent to show your changes and request for review. This is a safer way to get the initial bugs out and code coverages.
* Issue - So Github has a issue tracker for each project where you can find open issues or bugs found in the project. You can even use the issue tracker for posting new feature introductions 
* Fork - Forking is a process where you create a separate copy for your self into your account. You that piece of project code is into your stub. 
* Clone - This process helps you to dump the project code into your machine. Interesting right.

## Report a bug

Bug/issue management is one of the least sexy ways to contribute to an open source project, but it’s also one of the most important. When you find a bug in an open source package you use, report it into the project’s bug tracking system. This is probably the single most useful thing you can do to contribute to a project, because if users don’t report bugs, chances are that the developers won’t find about them. If the developers knew about the bugs, they would have fixed them, right? If you really want to help, take the time to do a good solid write-up into the project’s bug tracking system.

## Verify and track down a reported bug

You can also go through the bug tracking system and help improve existing trouble tickets. Find a bug and see if you can reproduce it on your system. This can be invaluable to the developers trying to narrow down the cause of a problem.

## Write an example for the documentation

Few developers are eager to write documentation, but it’s critical to the success of open source projects. What’s the first thing you look for when exploring a new project? The documentation. And what’s the first thing you look for in that documentation? Examples of how to use it. It’s easy to come up with examples for the documentation if you’ve been using the software for a while. For projects related to programming, such as a library or a framework, create a simple example that shows a common use case of the code. In many cases, you can take working code of your own, extract the most interesting parts, and you have a real-world example to help new users understand quickly.
